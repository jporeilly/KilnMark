# Development guide

## Platforms

Kilnmark servers run on **Linux** (see [ADR 0002](adr/0002-linux-on-prem-one-image.md)).
You can develop on Windows, macOS or Linux: the server is plain Java, and the database runs in
a container.

| Tool | Version | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Java | 17 or later on the PATH | Starting the Gradle wrapper; it fetches JDK 25 itself |
| Git | any recent | Source control |
| Node.js | 22 or later | The web UI |
| Podman (Podman Desktop with a WSL 2 machine on Windows), or Docker | Podman 5 or later | PostgreSQL and the full stack |

**Java 25 is downloaded for you.** The build runs on JDK 25 (`gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties`)
and compiles with it; if the machine has none, Gradle downloads one into its own cache the first
time. Any Java 17 or later on the `PATH` is enough to start the wrapper, so leave `JAVA_HOME` as
Pentaho and Tomcat expect it.

Gradle is not needed: use the wrapper (`./gradlew`, or `gradlew.bat` on Windows).

## Build and test

```
./gradlew build                 # compile, test, write output to dist/build
./gradlew :server:quarkusDev    # live-reload server on http://localhost:8780
./gradlew release               # assemble dist/release/kilnmark-<version>
```

Ports: Kilnmark listens on **8780** (8080 is left for Pentaho, Tomcat and the like) and its
PostgreSQL is published on **5442**. Change them with `KILNMARK_PORT` and `KILNMARK_DB_PORT` for
Compose, or `QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT` for the server on its own.

Useful endpoints in dev mode (all but the first and the `/q` ones need an API token; see
[Sign in](#sign-in)):

- `GET /api/v1/info`: product, version and roles
- `GET /api/v1/me`: who the token belongs to
- `POST /api/v1/sources`, `POST /api/v1/sources/import`, `POST /api/v1/sources/{name}/scans`
- `GET /api/v1/search?q=...`, `GET /api/v1/assets/{urn}`, `GET /api/v1/runs/{id}`
- `GET /api/v1/documents/text?urn=...&page=N`, `GET /api/v1/documents/find?urn=...&q=...`,
  `GET /api/v1/documents/chunks?urn=...&offset=0&limit=5`: a document's text (see
  [Documents](#documents))
- `POST /api/v1/tokens`, `GET /api/v1/tokens`, `DELETE /api/v1/tokens/{id}`: API tokens (admin)
- `GET /q/health`: health checks
- `GET /q/openapi`: the API specification

## Run the stack

```
podman machine start            # Windows and macOS only, once per boot
./gradlew :server:quarkusBuild  # build the server first
podman compose up --build       # PostgreSQL (AGE, pgvector) and the Kilnmark server
```

If `podman compose` reports `failed to connect to the docker API at npipe:////./pipe/podman-machine-default`,
the compose tool cannot find Podman: start the machine (`podman machine start`), or point it at
the machine's pipe (`podman machine inspect --format "{{.ConnectionInfo.PodmanPipe.Path}}"`, then
`$env:DOCKER_HOST = "npipe://" + that path with forward slashes`), or turn on Docker compatibility
in Podman Desktop's settings.

`podman compose` uses whichever compose provider is installed (Podman Desktop can install
`podman-compose` or `docker-compose`). Docker users run `docker compose up --build` instead; the
same `compose.yaml` and Containerfiles work for both
([ADR 0011](adr/0011-container-runtime.md)).

Integration tests use Testcontainers, against the same PostgreSQL image Kilnmark ships. Build it
once (and after changing it) before `./gradlew build`:

```
podman build -t kilnmark-postgres:dev -f containers/postgres/Containerfile containers/postgres
```

With Podman, point Testcontainers at the Podman socket:
set `DOCKER_HOST` to the address `podman machine inspect` reports, and
`TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true` if Ryuk fails to start under rootless Podman.

The server applies database migrations on start. To run separate roles, set `KILNMARK_ROLES`,
for example `KILNMARK_ROLES=worker`.

## Sign in

Every API call needs an API token except three public ones: `GET /api/v1/info`, the health
checks under `/q/health`, and the API description at `/q/openapi` (it lists endpoints, never
data). The token goes in a header:
`Authorization: Bearer km_...`. The web UI asks for one on its sign-in page and keeps it only
for that browser tab. A token has one role, and each role includes the ones before it:

| Role | Can |
| --- | --- |
| `viewer` | search, and read assets, sources, runs and connectors |
| `steward` | also start scans |
| `admin` | also add and import sources, and create, list and revoke tokens |

**The first admin token.** On first start, when no admin token is usable, the server creates
one and writes it to a file called `admin-token` in the same folder as the secret key file
(`kilnmark.secret-key-file`): `~/.kilnmark/admin-token` in dev mode, and
`/var/lib/kilnmark/admin-token` in the container (the `keys` volume). The file is readable only by
the server's user; the log says where it is, never what it holds. Read it with, for example,
`podman compose exec kilnmark cat /var/lib/kilnmark/admin-token`.

This token **works for 24 hours only**. Sign in with it, open **API tokens**, and create a
permanent admin token for yourself (role admin, expires never), and keep that somewhere safe.
The file can then be deleted. If every admin token is later revoked or expired, the next start
writes a new 24-hour one in the same place, so restarting the server is how to get back in.

**Or set it yourself.** `KILNMARK_ADMIN_TOKEN` (or `kilnmark.admin-token`) gives the server an
admin token, stored hashed on start; no file is written. It must be `km_` followed by at least 43
letters, digits, `-` or `_`:

```
export KILNMARK_ADMIN_TOKEN=km_$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=')
```

Changing or removing the variable sets the previous value aside on the next start; setting it
back brings that token back. A token an admin revoked under **API tokens** stays revoked even if
the variable still holds it (choose a new value). If that leaves no usable admin token, the
server writes a 24-hour `admin-token` file as above. Give every api instance the same value.

Token names may not hold line breaks or other control characters, and are written to the log
only with such characters replaced, so a name cannot forge a log line.

**Tokens for scripts.** Create them under **API tokens** in the UI, or:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8780/api/v1/tokens -H "Authorization: Bearer $KILNMARK_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "nightly-ci", "role": "steward", "expiresAt": "2027-01-31T00:00:00Z"}'
```

The response holds the token once; only its SHA-256 is stored. `DELETE /api/v1/tokens/{id}`
revokes one at once.

**Lab use only:** `KILNMARK_AUTH_MODE=off` turns sign-in off: anyone who can reach the server
is an admin, and no tokens can be created. The server only starts this way when it listens on a
loopback address (`QUARKUS_HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1`), and logs a warning on every start. The setting
takes `tokens` (the default) or `off`; any other value, a typo for example, stops the server
rather than guessing.

## Workers and the job queue

Scans run on the worker role. `POST /api/v1/sources/{name}/scans` (api role) only queues the
scan, as a run plus a job in PostgreSQL; any process with the worker role picks it up, so api and
worker can run in separate containers. A process without the worker role never runs a scan; if no
worker is running, scans stay `queued`.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kilnmark.worker.concurrency` (`KILNMARK_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`) | `2` | Scans one worker runs at the same time |
| `kilnmark.worker.poll-interval` | `5s` | How often to look for jobs when no notification arrives |
| `kilnmark.worker.heartbeat-interval` | `10s` | How often a running job reports that it is alive |
| `kilnmark.worker.stale-after` | `2m` | A running job silent this long, whose worker is gone, is recovered |
| `kilnmark.worker.max-attempts` | `3` | Tries before a job and its run are marked failed |
| `kilnmark.worker.shutdown-timeout` | `30s` | On shutdown, how long running scans may take before they are requeued |

Workers wake at once on a PostgreSQL notification and poll as a fallback. A source has at most
one scan waiting or running: asking for another returns the one in progress. While a worker scans
a source it holds a lock on that source, so two scans of one source never overlap. If a worker
dies, the next worker to check (on start, then every 30 seconds) puts its jobs back in the queue,
or marks them failed once they have been tried `max-attempts` times.

**Stopping a worker.** On shutdown a worker stops taking jobs and lets running scans finish for
up to `shutdown-timeout` (30 s). Scans still running are then asked to stop, which takes up to
15 s more, and go back in the queue without using up an attempt; another worker starts them
again. Give the container time for this, or it is killed first and its scans wait for stale-job
recovery (`stale-after`, 2 minutes) instead:

- Compose: `compose.yaml` sets `stop_grace_period: 60s` on the `kilnmark` service (the default is
  10 s).
- Kubernetes: set `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60` in the worker's pod spec (the default is
  30 s).

With a shorter grace period, lower `KILNMARK_WORKER_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` to leave 15 s or more. Each scan also profiles
`kilnmark.scan.parallel-tables` tables at a time, so one worker reads up to
`concurrency × parallel-tables` tables at once.

## Try it on the reference lab

Start Kilnmark first, then the lab, which joins Kilnmark's network (`kilnmark`):

```
podman compose up -d                          # Kilnmark on http://localhost:8780
podman compose -f lab/compose.yaml up -d      # the lab, reachable from Kilnmark by name
```

Open http://localhost:8780, sign in, go to **Sources**, and add the lab. Kilnmark reaches it by service
name, the same under Podman and Docker:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | PostgreSQL |
| Name | `lab` |
| JDBC URL | `jdbc:postgresql://lab-postgres:5432/lab` |
| User name / password | `lab` / `lab` |

(From the machine itself the lab is on `localhost:5433`, and its S3 on `localhost:9000`.)

Press **Scan now**. A scan of the lab (six tables, 10 million rows once `lab.make_big_table` has
run) takes about 15 seconds. Then search for `customer` and open `crm.customers`.

To register many sources at once, import a CSV (header row `name, url, username, password,
password_ref, schemas`) or a JSON array under **Sources > Import sources from a file**, or post it
to `POST /api/v1/sources/import` (`?dryRun=true` only checks).

Sign in first with the admin token from `admin-token` (see [Sign in](#sign-in)). API tokens are
for machines and for the lab; people will sign in through OpenID Connect from v0.2
([ADR 0014](adr/0014-authentication.md)).

## Documents

The `files` and `s3` connectors read the text of PDF, Office, OpenDocument, EPUB, RTF, HTML, XML,
mail, plain text and Markdown files ([ADR 0017](adr/0017-documents.md)). Each document's asset page
shows what was found (pages, words, language, title, author, dates, mail headers), its text page by
page with find, a workbook's sheets (read as tables where they have a header row) and a message's
attachments. Search finds words in documents' text and shows a snippet.

Documents are untrusted input, so reading them is limited:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kilnmark.documents.max-file-mb` | `100` | Larger documents are recorded, not read |
| `kilnmark.documents.max-legacy-file-mb` | `30` | The same for .doc, .xls, .ppt and .msg, which are read whole into memory |
| `kilnmark.documents.max-part-mb` | `64` | Office files with a part (other than worksheets, slides, a document's body or media) that really expands past this are not read |
| `kilnmark.documents.max-characters` | `1000000` | Text kept from one document, attachments included |
| `kilnmark.documents.timeout-seconds` | `60` | A document still being read after this is abandoned (a sheet: 1,024 rows within this); documents waiting for a reader are not timed |
| `kilnmark.documents.max-depth` | `3` | How deep files inside files (attachments, embedded objects) are read |
| `kilnmark.documents.threads` | `2` | Documents read at the same time across the server |
| `kilnmark.documents.chunk-characters` | `1500` | Size of the chunks text is stored and searched in |
| `kilnmark.documents.chunk-overlap` | `150` | Characters each chunk repeats from the one before |

A source's setting `keep_text=false` keeps only documents' properties: no text is stored (text
stored before is deleted at the next scan) and none is shown. With `read_text_on_demand=true` as
well, stewards can still read a document's text on its asset page: it is read from the source when
they open it, on a reader of its own, at most six documents a minute each, and never stored.
Copies of S3 objects are made in a folder under `java.io.tmpdir` that only the server's user can
read, and deleted after (a workbook's copy is kept until the scan ends, so a scan fetches it once).

## Web UI

```
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173, calls the server on :8780
npm run build      # writes dist/ui
```

## Rules

- Versions go up by exactly 0.0.1 per release.
