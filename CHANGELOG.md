# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Sign-in with API tokens:** every API call except `/api/v1/info` and `/q/health` needs a
  token (`Authorization: Bearer km_...`) with a role: viewer (read), steward (also start scans)
  or admin (also add sources and manage tokens). Tokens are shown once and stored only as
  SHA-256 hashes; they can expire and be revoked at once. The first start writes an admin token
  to `admin-token` next to the secret key, or takes one from `KILNMARK_ADMIN_TOKEN`.
- **Web UI:** a sign-in page, sign-out, and an **API tokens** page for admins (create with a
  role and expiry, copy the new token once, revoke). Viewers no longer see controls they cannot
  use. Pages no longer scroll sideways on phones.
- **Job queue:** scans are queued in PostgreSQL and run by any process with the worker role, so
  api and worker can run apart. Workers wake on `LISTEN/NOTIFY` and also poll, run
  `kilnmark.worker.concurrency` scans at a time (default 2), never run the same scan twice at
  once, recover scans left by a worker that stopped, and finish running scans before shutting
  down.
- **Database:** migration V4 adds the `api_token` and `job` tables.
- **Sources:** SQL Server (kind `sqlserver`): tables and views in user schemas,
  with `MS_Description` descriptions and primary keys; every SQL Server type read, with
  `datetimeoffset` as a UTC timestamp, `money` as an exact decimal, and geography, geometry and
  hierarchyid as text. Reads take no shared locks by default (setting `isolation`:
  `read-uncommitted`, `snapshot` or `read-committed`). Uses Microsoft's JDBC driver (MIT).
- **Sources:** a JDBC URL holding a password is refused; enter it as the source's password, which
  is encrypted.
- **Fixed:** a schema whose name holds `_` (such as `a_b`) no longer picks up the columns of a
  same-named table in a schema it matches as a pattern (`axb`); PostgreSQL schemas named `sys` or
  `guest` are scanned.
- **Fixed:** a read stopped early by a failing step now ends at once instead of reading the rest
  of the table.

## 0.0.2 (24 October 2026)

The first working slice: point Kilnmark at PostgreSQL databases, scan them, and search what it
found.

- **Sources:** register PostgreSQL databases one at a time, or many at once from a CSV or JSON
  file (checked row by row, all or nothing, with a dry run). Passwords are encrypted with
  AES-256-GCM before they reach the database; the key lives outside it. Bulk files can refer to
  passwords as `env:VARIABLE` or `secret:NAME` instead of holding them.
- **Scans:** every table and view, with columns, types, comments and primary keys; each one read
  through the Kiln engine and profiled as it streams (rows, nulls, distinct values, ranges,
  lengths, most common values). Two tables at a time; one failing does not stop the scan. Assets
  that disappear from a source are marked removed.
- **Search:** tables, views and columns by name or description, tolerant of partial and misspelt
  words.
- **Web UI:** search from anywhere (Ctrl+K), sources with scan status, asset pages with every
  column's profile. WCAG 2.2 AA automated checks pass in light and dark themes.
- **Kiln engine:** steps on virtual threads joined by bounded Arrow row sets, per-step memory
  accounting, back-pressure, clean failure and leak reporting.
- **Platform:** Java 25 (ADR 0013), Business Source License 1.1 (ADR 0008), sign-in plan
  (ADR 0014). No sign-in yet: lab use only.
